##React-Native with GraphQl

- Setting up android sdk (marshmallow needed)

###NOTES:
styles: {
  *'flex' is described in 'ratio';
  *'width' is desribed in px as long as it in number. For % write it as string '23%''
  *react-native Platform for specific styles in component;
  *Header can't by styled - wrapp in View;
},

diff OS: {
  *naming convention .android.js, .ios.js - keep diff files fr diff os;
  * {
       if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
          consle.log('ios');
        } else if (Platform.android === 'android') {
          console.log('android');
        }
    };

}

All the rest is react.
